<summary>There were failures symbolizing some of the crashes I found</summary>

When processing null I found crash

```
Crash(engineVariant: EngineVariant(os: android, arch: null, mode: null), frames: [CrashFrame.android(no: 00, pc: 107580, binary: /system/lib/libc.so, rest:  (abort+63), buildId: null), CrashFrame.android(no: 01, pc: 2870917, binary: /data/app/com.example.app/lib/arm/libflutter.so, rest:  (offset 0x1002000), buildId: null)], format: native, androidMajorVersion: 8)
```

but failed to symbolize it with the following notes:

* Unknown engine ABI

See [my documentation](https://github.com/flutter-symbolizer-bot/flutter-symbolizer-bot/blob/main/README.md#commands) for more details.
